# Assignment 2: Simple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of state-wide average and proportion data collected from the US Census. The dataset consists of 13 variables across 50 observations, where each observation corresponds to one of the 50 US states. Two of the variables, `STATE` and `REGION`, are nominal categorical variables, while the remaining 11 are continuous. The primary objective is to build and evaluate several linear regression models that can be used to predict `HouseholdIncome` and explore other potential relationships within the dataset.

## Key Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine the dataset and identify variables with predictive potential.
- Develop multiple linear regression models to predict `HouseholdIncome` using various explanatory variables.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate statistical measures such as R-squared values and hypothesis testing on regression coefficients.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Techniques:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, Sum of Squared Residuals, Sum of Squares Total, Sum of Squares due to Regression, R-squared, Standardized Residuals, Standardized Residuals Plots, ANOVA tables

## Summary
In this project, linear regression models were successfully developed to identify key variables that impact `HouseholdIncome`. The analysis demonstrated strong relationships between several predictors such as `COLLEGE` (positive) and `OBESE` (negative), which significantly influenced household income levels across US states. Through exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation, the project showcased the use of linear regression as an effective tool for understanding relationships within census data. The inclusion of ANOVA tables and hypothesis testing further solidified the model's validity and applicability. Overall, the assignment provided valuable insights into the data and reinforced the understanding of OLS regression techniques in a real-world context.
